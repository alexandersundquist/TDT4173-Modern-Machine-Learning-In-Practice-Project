    "#### Data About the Vessel \n",
    "As different vessels often follow different paths related to what kind of ship they are, we looked into the characteristics of the vessels. To give an idicator of what kind of vessel a given vessel was we realized that breadth, length and how much it can carry say much about the characteristics of a ship. When it comes to length and breadth they were given in the vessels information. There were several features related to size and weight the vessels could carry like 'CEU' and 'DWT'. CEU refers to car equivalent unit and tells how many car a vessel can carry. DWT is Deadwethh Tonnage and tells us how much a vessel can safely carry. 'GT' tells more about the volume/sioxe and stands for gross tonnage. \n",
